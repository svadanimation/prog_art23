# File IO project

Create a script that reads and writes text and json files

- create a constant string `directory` with the value `Z:`
- create a constant string `text_file` with the value `text_file.txt`
- create a constant string `json_file` with the value `json_file.json`
- use the os.path.join  to assemble two file paths, `json_path` and `text_path`

---

- Create a string `text` with a mix of letters and numbers.
- Create a dictionary `data` with at least 5 key/value pairs and a **nested dictionary** with at least 2 key/value pairs.

- Create a function that safely writes the `text` to a text file on disk with the provided txt path . 
- Create a function that safely reads a string from a file name. This should return the numbers as a float/int and the characters as text.

- Create a function that takes the `data` dictionary and and writes it to disk as json with the provided json path.
- Create a function that reads a dictionary from disk.

---

- in an `__name__ == '__main__' block
- call the function to read and write the files
- print the results of the text file using named `f` strings
- print the results of the dictionary using the pretty printer `pprint`
